# Brick Building Robot Manipulation
Graduate-level independent project written by Sarah Ziselman utilizing the HDT Adroit A24 Manipulator Arm and MoveIt! C++ API to pick and place bricks to build a wall. Navigation will be done through collaborator using a Clear Path Jackal UGV robot.

## Introduction
This project explores motion planning and manipulation of the HDT Adroit Arm in MoveIt!'s C++ API. The goal is to integrate the Adroit Robot with the Jackal UGV robot to create a brick building robot. The manipulation portion of the project will be used to pick up bricks and stack them in a wall formation depending on the approximate amount of bricks identified. This application is both practical and fun to work with, as it can work to increase efficiency in building structures.
